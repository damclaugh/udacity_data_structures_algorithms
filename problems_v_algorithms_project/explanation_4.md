## Explanation
The code uses a pivot value and places numbers less than the pivot to the left and larger numbers to the right. If a number is equal to the pivot, it remains in place.

## Efficiency
The algorithm traverses the array once as it sorts the numbers. The time complexity is therefore O(n) where n is the size of the array. Because the array is sorted in place and no extra space is used to store the values, the space complexity is O(1).
