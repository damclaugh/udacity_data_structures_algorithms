# Explanation
The code initializes the first element of the array as the minimum and maximum. It then traverses the array, checking each element and updating the minum and maximum as needed.

# Efficiency
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the size of the array. The time to run increases linearly as the array size gets bigger. Space complexity is O(1) because no additional space is used.
